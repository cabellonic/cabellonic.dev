I start this website as a personal project, and it's the result of mixing two of things I like the most: japanese music and programming. It is about a musician named Kenshi Yonezu.

The main goal of this project was make **a portal that collects everything related to the artist** in question, from his first song to the latest news.

The content in this portal is created through a Headless CMS ([Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)). With the tools listed on the top of this page I created a very complete site that meets the proposed objective.

When visiting the website you can see all the different sections:
- Articles to publish news and a category system to classify them.
- Interviews with an attractive format.
- Song pages.
- Album pages.
- Artist and user profiles.
