In order to enter the [Alkemy Labs](https://alkemy.org/) in April I had to solve a challenge, in which I had to develop a fullstack web application with React and Node.js that would allow the user to keep track of their expenses and income, Expense Tracker was the result.  

The reality is that I had very little time to develop all the features listed and I had been years without using relational databases and React without other frameworks like Next.js or Gatsby, so it was a really difficult challenge for me.

- A PostgreSQL database.
- A REST API.
- User system.
- Authentication with JWT.
- Private and public routes in the Frontend.
- A category system to filter expenses.

It is because of this lack of time that I could not create unit tests for the project, along with some other features that I would have liked to incorporate.  
I was able to save some time by making a mobile first design, adapting to desktop devices what was strictly necessary.
