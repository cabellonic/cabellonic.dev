This project arose in response to the need to have a website where to publish the translations that we have done together with some friends with whom we have this hobby in common.

Some of the features that the site has are:
- Song pages as the main axis of the page.
- The possibility to create articles
- Artist and user profiles

Although it is a project that I developed entirely by myself, the content of the page is not only mine, so the GitHub repository is, at least so far, private.
